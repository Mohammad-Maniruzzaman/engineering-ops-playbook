# Adoption & Change Model (Lightweight)

## Principle
Mechanisms only matter if teams adopt them. Adoption is measured, not assumed.

## 1) Pilot first
- Select **one** mechanism (e.g., Jira taxonomy + one dashboard).
- Pilot with 1–2 teams for 2–4 weeks.
- Define success metrics before rollout.

## 2) Measure signal
Examples:
- Ticket staleness rate (% not updated in 7 days)
- Blocked time (% of cycle time)
- Cycle time trend (median, p75)
- Status churn (reopened work, unclear ownership)
- Onboarding time-to-productivity

## 3) Roll out incrementally
- Expand team-by-team.
- Keep mechanisms minimal.
- Capture dissent; refine the standard.

## 4) Governance (light)
- One owner for standards; teams own content execution.
- Changes via PRs with short rationale.
- Quarterly “delete or simplify” review (remove process that adds overhead).
