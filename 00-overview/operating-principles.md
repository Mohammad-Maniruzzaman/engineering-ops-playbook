# Operating Principles (Engineering Ops)

## Purpose
Engineering Operations exists to increase execution quality and speed while minimizing overhead across Engineering, Data Science, and TPM/Program teams.

## Principles
1. **Highly aligned, loosely coupled**  
   Align on outcomes, interfaces, and ownership; avoid coordination debt.
2. **Truthful tracking**  
   Dashboards are only useful if workflow, fields, and hygiene are consistent.
3. **Lightweight mechanisms**  
   Prefer crisp templates and clear definitions over recurring meetings and ceremonies.
4. **Documentation is a product**  
   Curated, discoverable, owned, maintained, and tied to onboarding.
5. **Decisions are durable**  
   Record decisions and tradeoffs so teams do not re-litigate.
6. **Pilot before rollout**  
   Adopt changes incrementally with success metrics, feedback loops, and the willingness to delete what does not work.
