# Hack Day / Demo Fair Runbook

## Goals
- Encourage innovation and knowledge sharing
- Create visible demos and reusable artifacts
- Improve engineering culture and cross-team collaboration

## Timeline (suggested)
- T-3 weeks: announce theme, rules, and submission process
- T-2 weeks: collect team intents (1–2 paragraphs), confirm logistics
- T-1 week: finalize agenda, judging rubric, demo order
- Day-of: kickoff, build time, demos, awards
- T+1 week: publish demos + learnings, capture follow-ups

## Submission template
- Problem:
- Why it matters:
- What you built:
- Demo link:
- Repo/doc links:
- Next steps:

## Demo fair agenda (example)
- 5 min: kickoff + goals
- 60–90 min: demos (5–7 min each)
- 10 min: voting/judging
- 10 min: awards + closing

## Judging rubric (lightweight)
- Impact (user or engineering leverage)
- Novelty
- Execution quality
- Reusability (docs, code, handoff)

## Post-event hygiene
- Central page with all demos, links, and owners
- Capture follow-ups as Jira tickets with DRIs and dates
- 15-minute retro: what to improve next time
