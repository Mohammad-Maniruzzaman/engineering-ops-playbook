# Onboarding 30/60/90 Template (Technical)

## 0–2 weeks: Orientation + tooling
- Accounts, access, and environments
- Tooling basics (Jira, CI/CD, dashboards, docs hub)
- Key people map (team + cross-functional partners)
- Read top docs: architecture overview + runbooks + incident history

## 30 days: Productive contributions
- Shadow one oncall/incident review (or equivalent reliability ritual)
- Own one small scoped task end-to-end (with review)
- Understand planning cadence: how work is prioritized and tracked
- Draft one doc improvement (close a known gap)

## 60 days: Ownership
- Own a sub-area or recurring mechanism (e.g., dashboard hygiene, dependency tracking)
- Lead one cross-functional sync with a clear agenda and outcomes
- Produce one executive-ready artifact (readout or decision memo)

## 90 days: Leverage
- Identify and ship one operational improvement (reduce toil, improve truth, speed onboarding)
- Establish measurable outcomes and adoption plan
- Propose next-quarter improvements tied to planning cadence
