# 30/60/90 Onboarding Plan

## Objective
Reduce time-to-productivity for new engineers/TPMs by providing a clear path: systems context, operational mechanisms, and first wins.

## Day 1–7 (First week)
- Access + accounts (tools, repos, dashboards)
- Read: system overview + how-we-work
- Meet: key stakeholders + DRIs
- Ship: a small doc fix or dashboard improvement

## Days 8–30 (First month)
- Own one small mechanism (e.g., decision log hygiene, dependency register)
- Complete shadow rotations (planning, incident review, release)
- Deliver first scoped improvement with measurable impact

## Days 31–60 (Second month)
- Run a recurring cadence (weekly health review, planning prep)
- Drive one cross-team dependency to closure
- Improve one onboarding/doc area based on gaps found

## Days 61–90 (Third month)
- Own a program end-to-end (or major workstream)
- Establish durable artifacts: spec + runbook + dashboard
- Mentor a newer teammate on the mechanisms

## Example (filled): TPM onboarding to an Ads Engineering org

*Illustrative example — names and projects are placeholders.*

### Day 1–7
- Gain access: Jira project(s), dashboards, documentation hub, Slack channels
- Read:
  - `system-overview.md`
  - `how-we-work.md`
  - 1–2 runbooks for top operational issues
- Meet:
  - Ads Eng lead (expectations)
  - Data Science partner (metrics & measurement)
  - Platform partner (dependency patterns)
- Ship:
  - Create a “Start here” index update + add missing links to weekly readout and decision log

### Days 8–30
- Own mechanism: enforce “Blocked requires owner+ETA” and staleness SLA
- Shadow: planning cycle prep + one incident review
- Deliver: clean dependency register + weekly execution health dashboard; measure meeting time reduction

### Days 31–60
- Run cadence: weekly execution health review (10 mins) with decision capture
- Close one dependency: get upstream API contract confirmed with dates and DRIs
- Improve onboarding: add a “first-week checklist” and a glossary based on newcomer questions

### Days 61–90
- Own a program: integration readiness + rollout coordination
- Create durable artifacts:
  - architecture spec for change
  - runbook update for operational behavior
  - dashboard for adoption/defect tracking
- Train: run a 30-minute onboarding session for new joiners (“how we track, decide, and ship”)
