| Date | Decision | Context | Tradeoffs | Owner | Status | Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  | Proposed/Approved/Deprecated |  |

## Rules
- Decisions are recorded when they are made, not retroactively.
- Include tradeoffs and rationale to prevent re-litigation.
- Deprecated decisions remain searchable with a pointer to the new decision.
