# Slack & Distribution List Hygiene

## Goal
Reduce noise while improving clarity and response time.

## Channel conventions
- One channel per domain/program where possible (avoid duplicates).
- Use threads for updates and discussion; reserve main channel for announcements.

## Posting rules
- Lead with the ask or decision needed (not the backstory).
- Prefer short bullets; link to the source-of-truth (Jira ticket, doc, decision log).
- If it is a decision: record it in the decision log and share the link.

## Escalation
- Define an escalation path for blocked/at-risk items:
  - Blocked with ETA < 7 days: resolve in-thread with owner
  - High-impact and within 2 weeks: escalate to owner’s manager with a crisp ask
  - No progress after escalation: raise in exec readout with specific decision needed

## Distribution lists
- Keep DLs purpose-specific and reviewed quarterly.
- Remove passive recipients where possible; use dashboards/SSOT for visibility instead.
