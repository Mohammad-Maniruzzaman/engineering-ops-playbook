# Dependency Register Template

| Dependency | Type (Tech/Decision/Resourcing/External) | Blocking / Blocked | Owner (DRI) | Needed by | Status | Next action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Operating rules
- Every dependency has a single owner and a date.
- “In progress” without a next action is not a status.
- Escalate based on impact and proximity (e.g., within 2 weeks).
