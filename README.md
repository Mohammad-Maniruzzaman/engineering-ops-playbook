# Engineering Ops Playbook

Lightweight, practical mechanisms to improve execution quality for Engineering, Data Science, and TPM/Program teams—focused on **truthful tracking, low-overhead planning, durable decisions, and scalable knowledge**.

If you are hiring for Engineering Operations / Program Management roles, this repo is intended to demonstrate operating-model design and clear communication artifacts.

## What this playbook improves
- Jira workflows/fields vary across teams → dashboards become unreliable
- Planning cycles create churn/logistics overhead instead of clarity
- Documentation is fragmented/stale → onboarding is slow and repetitive
- Updates are noisy → decisions are not durable or discoverable
- Tool pilots (including GenAI) lack guardrails and success criteria

## What’s inside (clickable)
- **Jira governance** → `jira-governance/`  
  Workflow standards, taxonomy/data integrity rules, dashboard definitions
- **Planning cadence** → `planning-cadence/`  
  Quarterly planning template, dependency register, executive readout (1 page)
- **Docs hub + onboarding** → `docs-hub-and-onboarding/`  
  SSOT structure, architecture spec template, 30/60/90 onboarding plan
- **Comms hygiene** → `comms-hygiene/`  
  Weekly update template, decision log, Slack/DL hygiene rules
- **GenAI ops** → `genai-ops/`  
  Pilot proposal template (guardrails + metrics) and reusable prompt patterns
- **Culture events** → `events/`  
  Hack day/demo fair runbook

## Start here (fast path)
- `jira-governance/taxonomy-and-data-integrity.md`
- `planning-cadence/exec-readout-template.md`
- `genai-ops/genai-pilot-template.md`

## How to use (recommended)
1) Start with `00-overview/operating-principles.md`.
2) Pilot one mechanism for 2–4 weeks (e.g., Jira taxonomy + 1 dashboard + exec readout).
3) Measure adoption + outcomes (staleness, cycle time, status churn, onboarding time).
4) Roll out incrementally with a clear ownership model.

## Design principles
- Mechanisms must reduce toil, not create it.
- Truth > optics: tracking must be trusted.
- Documentation is a product: curated, owned, and used.
- Decisions are recorded and searchable.
- Tools are rolled out via pilots with measurable success criteria and guardrails.

This repository contains generic templates and examples only and does not include employer-proprietary information.
