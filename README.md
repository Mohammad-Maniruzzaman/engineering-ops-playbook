# Engineering Ops Playbook

Lightweight mechanisms to help Engineering, Data Science, and TPM/Program teams execute with clarity and speed—without adding bureaucracy.

This playbook focuses on five areas that routinely determine execution quality in large technical organizations:
1) trusted tracking (Jira governance + data integrity)
2) planning cadence mechanics (templates that reduce overhead)
3) single source of truth (docs + onboarding as a product)
4) communication hygiene (signal over noise)
5) operational scaling with GenAI (pilots with guardrails + measurable impact)

## What problems this playbook addresses
- Jira workflows/fields vary across teams, making dashboards unreliable
- Planning cycles create churn and logistics load instead of clarity
- Documentation is fragmented and goes stale; onboarding is slow
- Updates are noisy; decisions are not recorded or discoverable
- Tool pilots (including GenAI) lack guardrails and success criteria

## What’s inside
- **Jira governance**: workflow standards, taxonomy/data integrity rules, dashboard definitions
- **Planning cadence**: quarterly planning template, dependency register, executive readout (1 page)
- **Docs hub + onboarding**: SSOT structure, architecture spec template, 30/60/90 onboarding plan
- **Comms hygiene**: weekly update template, decision log, Slack/DL rules
- **GenAI ops**: pilot proposal template + reusable prompt patterns
- **Culture events**: hack day / demo fair runbook

## How to use (recommended)
1) Start with `00-overview/operating-principles.md`.
2) Pilot one mechanism for 2–4 weeks (e.g., Jira taxonomy + 1 dashboard + exec readout).
3) Measure adoption + outcomes (staleness, cycle time, status churn, onboarding time).
4) Roll out incrementally with a clear ownership model.

## Design principles
- Mechanisms must reduce toil, not create it.
- Truth > optics: tracking must be trusted.
- Documentation is a product: curated, owned, and used.
- Decisions are recorded and searchable.
- Tools are rolled out via pilots with measurable success criteria and guardrails.
